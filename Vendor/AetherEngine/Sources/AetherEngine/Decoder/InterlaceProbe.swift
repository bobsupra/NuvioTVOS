/// #232: verifies a DECLARED interlaced H.264 stream against what the decoder actually emits.
///
/// The declaration and the decoder disagree systematically on progressive-in-interlaced-carriage
/// (PsF). Blu-ray has no 1080p25, so European 25 fps masters ship as 1080i25: interlaced carriage,
/// progressive pictures. FFmpeg then answers the same SEI two different ways:
///
/// - `h264_parser.c` (feeds `codecpar.field_order`, which is what the routing rule reads) sets
///   `AV_FIELD_TT` for a FRAME-coded picture on SEI `pic_struct == TOP_BOTTOM` alone. It weighs
///   neither `ct_type` nor how the slices were actually coded.
/// - `h264_slice.c` (feeds `AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED`) flags that same picture only when it is
///   field- or MBAFF-coded, and a `clock_timestamp` carrying `ct_type` overrides even that.
///
/// So the routing rule consumes the structurally less informed of the two values.
///
/// The probe deliberately does NOT try to answer "is this content progressive". It answers the
/// narrower question the routing rule actually rests on: WILL THE DEINTERLACER EVER ENGAGE.
/// `SoftwareVideoDecoder` engages it on `AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` and on nothing else, so a
/// sample in which that flag never appears proves the software detour is a no-op for this stream:
/// what plays today is already the un-deinterlaced picture, and the native path renders the same
/// frames with hardware decode.
///
/// Because the probe's predicate IS the engagement predicate, its false positives are harmless by
/// construction. A stream whose first frame is flagged only because of libavcodec's
/// `prev_interlaced_frame = 1` decoder-init bias (h264_slice.c, the pic_struct=3 without ct_type
/// case) is exactly the stream on which the real software path would engage the deinterlacer at
/// that same frame and latch it. Reporting "interlaced" there is not a miss, it is agreement with
/// the runtime.

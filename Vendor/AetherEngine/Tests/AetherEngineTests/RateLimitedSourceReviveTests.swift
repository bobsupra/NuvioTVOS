/// #377: a 429 is a NOT-YET, and the engine used to read it as a death.
///
/// The reader classifies the refusal (`isRateLimitStatus`) and then throws the classification away:
/// its give-up arm returns a bare `-1`, so `handleVODReadErrorExit` saw the same code a genuinely
/// dead source produces. It spent the ordinary two-attempt budget inside a minute, each attempt
/// reopening from byte 0 against an origin refusing exactly that, and declared the source "not
/// readable in this session" while the same stream plays instantly on a fresh press of play.

/// #240 (cmcpherson274, custom tvOS host, 48 GB 4K remux over ~90 Mbit/s Wi-Fi): far seeks in a
/// rapid sequence landed in 13 to 25 s instead of the 4 to 6 s an isolated seek took, and the same
/// segment that served in 2.2 s alone took 7.5 s in the burst. Same bytes, same link: something else
/// was using it.
///
/// It was the subtitle side reader. On Matroska a "subtitle-only" reader is a second full copy of
/// the stream (`matroska_parse_cluster` reads every block off the wire, `matroska_parse_block` only
/// then honours the discard flag), so a subtitled session asks the link for about twice the media
/// rate, measured at 2.6x in #220. At 1.38x headroom the two readers split the link, the seek
/// landing budget expired, and the recovery re-anchor jumped the clock, which rebuilt the prefetch
/// session, which took more link: the engine starved itself in a loop it kept feeding.
///
/// The fix is a strict priority rather than a share. Playback is load-bearing, subtitle lookahead is
/// not, so a side reader fetches while the video path does not need the link, with a bounded grace
/// window after each anchor so a fresh selection is not left with an empty store, and a yield cap so
/// a signal that never clears cannot mute lookahead for the session either.
